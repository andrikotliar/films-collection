# Films Collection

A personal list of films with manually collected data. The app primarily focuses on representing basic film data and some of the author's subjective perspectives, such as ratings, collections, and comments.

## Start development server

1. In the project root, run `npm run install:all` to install dependencies for both the client and server.
2. Go to the `server` directory and create `.env` file. Copy variables from the `env.sample.txt`.
3. Inside the `server` directory run the following scripts to migrate and seed database:

```shell
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

4. Go to the `client` directory, create `.env` file and fill it with variables from the `env.sample.txt`.
5. In the project's root run `npm run dev`.  This will start both the client and server using `concurrently`.
6. Open `http://localhost:3030`

## Build project

1. Run `npm run build` in the project's root. The command builds the code into `client/dist` and `server/dist`.

The backend is ready to deploy to fly.io, see [docs](https://fly.io/docs/launch/deploy/)

## Dataset

The dataset folder contains data to populate a database. It consists of two folders:

1. `general` - collection of base data:
- genres;
- countries;
- studios;
- collections;
- people - actors, directors, writers etc.;
- awards;
- nominations.

2. `films` - JSON files containing film information. The folder includes a `_schema.json` file, which explains each field in the JSON files and validates them.

To ensure proper seeding, general data should be populated before adding films, as film JSONs contain references to that data.

An example of a seeding script can be found in `server/prisma/seed.ts`. It uses Prisma ORM, but the data can be adapted for other popular ORMs, some of which support seeding data with nested relations out of the box.
