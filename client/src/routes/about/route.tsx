        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Andrii üëã </p>
        <p>
          I'm a big fan of films and TV shows and like to collect information
          about them. This is the purpose of this app. The collection contains
          only films, TV shows and animation I like.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most favorite genres are Sci-Fi and Fantasy. But I also like
          animation, adventures, action, disaster. And less like detectives,
          crime and comedies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't give preference some actors and directors in films, but really
          like James Cameron as a director and Tom Cruise as an actor.

        <h2>Story of the app</h2>
        <p>
          My love for cinema started in my early childhood with movies like
          Terminator, The Matrix, and Star Wars. The Internet wasn't widespread
          then and to see a new film I had to wait until a movie was released on
          a TV. I didn't have a chance to go to the cinema due to my
          geographical location. Weekly I hoped to find a good movie in a TV
          program to see on Saturday or Sunday. Every day I looked forward to
          seeing a new episode of my favorite animation shows. Even then I tried
          drawing characters from cartoons and writing down short information
          about them in a notebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I got a DVD. It gave me access to a larger collection of movies.
          One evening I wrote down a list of movies I watched and liked. After
          that, I added short plot descriptions to this list. Everything was
          done in simple notebooks.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a year or two I got my first laptop, still without the Internet
          connection, and I moved my notes into digital documents. I added more
          details about movies to the list, like directors, cast, and other
          summary information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my teenage ages, I got familiar with Japanese anime and also became
          interested in graphical design. I converted all my notes from
          documents into banners. This idea and my delight in anime didn't last
          so long. Now my collection contains only a few representatives of this
          subtype of cinema.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last stage of this collection creation started when I learned web
          development. Firstly it was simple HTML pages, that later became
          full-fledged SPA-app which I keep working on today. This app is a kind
          of blog, where I collect my favorite movies and sometimes write
          synopses, short comments, and feelings after watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see from my collection, I like simple, mass, not
          pretentious cinema. I never was a fan of art-house and high school of
          cinema. Unlikely you face here winners of the Oscar, but face most
          movies that gain the million dollars box office. I do like all movies
          from my collection though, each of them gives me viewing pleasure.

        <h2>Ratings</h2>
        <p>I rate films in the collection by three-stars rating:</p>
        <p>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: My best favorites. I've watched them countless times.</p>
        <p>
          ‚≠ê‚≠ê<i>‚≠ê</i>: Good titles I do like. I've watched them less times
          than previous category, but always excited to watch them one more
          time. Majority of titles in the collection have this rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚≠ê<i>‚≠ê</i>
          <i>‚≠ê</i>: Titles I still like but they have some nuances or were
          added just to have in the collection. I've watched them only a few
          times and usually choose to watch one more time some titles from the
          previous categories.
